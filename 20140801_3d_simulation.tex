The goal is to add in the first regression parameter into the 3D simulation study. 
This parameter will be a proxy for temperature. To understand the relationship between
temperature and depth (the only other variable already included in the model), a
plot of temperature against depth for all stations is shown below.


It appears that stations within 50km of the ice edge have a different temperature/depth
relationship to those further offshore. Distance offshore is not a parameter that
is currently included in the simulation study so for now, only one of these relationships
will be captured in the simulation study. The closer stations have a negative 
exponential like relationship, so this will be added to the simulation data set.
